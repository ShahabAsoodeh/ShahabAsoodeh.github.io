				I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scholar affiliated jointly with Computation Institute and Institute of Genetics and\ 
				System Biology at The University of Chicago. I work with James Evans and Ishanu Chattopadhyay. Prior to that, I was a PhD student in\ 
				the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Queen's University under the supervision of Tamas Linder and Fady Alajaji.

				I can use my skills here to create websites for my business, my friends and family, my C.V, blog or articles. As well as any games or more experiment stuff (which is what the web is really all about).
